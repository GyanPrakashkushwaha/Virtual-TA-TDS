Some network setting might be causing problem. Alternatively you can make use of GitHub codespaces which provides 120 hours of free run time in a month. With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains. I have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.Hi samra, Try installing some other browser see if that works.Hi mishkat, Without sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question.Ok, thanks. I turned off many security features including anti-virus system’s security and windows security options etc. Then it allowed me to download uv on the system. Now it is running, and I got output as json for Q2.2 days ago I attempted TDS 2025 Jan GA1 - Development Tools and scored 8.5. I didn’t submit as I wanted to attempt incorrect answer questions. When I logged in today it says score is 0. Shall I submit or not? Do I have to attempt all questions again? Why the assignment and submissions are two separate pages/links? If [seek] ( Nptel Seekh ) can access [TDS exam] ( Technical Assessment ) then why we need to submit from seek?The seek portal question is to confirm that the student has seen the GA. It does not actually give you a score. Otherwise students sometimes claim that they looked and did not find any GAs (this has happened in the past). Hence the two stage verification. You still need to the submissions to get a score for the GA. The actual GA questions are on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ via the seek portal or on the Tools in Data Science introduction page. Its just a more robust way of ensuring that students have indeed viewed the GAs. As far your submission goes, we have your last submission and the score. We will check on our end why your submission has not reloaded into your browser. Normally these are stored in session storage. So if your browser has deleted them, it might have not loaded from our back end server. @s.anand will be able to confirm the reason for this problem. For the time being if you are making a fresh submission, just fill in all the answers in again, so that your latest submission will be marked correctly. Kind regardsThanks @carlton . I answered questions on https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/ but didn’t click on the button “Submit Answers” on seek as my answers for 2 questions were incorrect. My question is whether I need to submit on seek to save answers on Exam? (I checked my score and saved it on the exam site.)Hi @Nelson Your answers on the exam site that have been submitted will be saved and used as the basis for your score. Saying yes/no on seek does not materially impact scoring. Its just an awareness question. Even if you answered yes on the seek portal, you can still revise your answers on the exam site. The final submission is always whats locked in for the score (until the deadline passes). Kind regardsIt might be because you are not adding up the correct tags with attribute data-value . There may be other tags within the same DOM and having the attribute data-value . Kind regardsI am stuck with the last question. SQLite question. It gives the error: Error: Got [[121510.39]]... Is it possible to have a more descriptive error? It’s a simple SQL query. I tried various options in my query. I didn’t succeed.Hi Nelson, I checked your set of questions, you are using wrong query to get answer. kind regards@carlton @Jivraj In this picture for the given question i have tried in python and chatgpt both are giving same answer still showing wrong.

I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network. kind regards kind regards@Nelson I would recommend Podman or Docker CE rather than Docker Desktop . Docker Desktop is not free for organizations over 250 people and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.@s.anand @carlton @Jivraj I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.@22f2001640 in that case a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080 Please try one of these: Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network GitHub codespaces, as @Jivraj suggested You could try an ngrok alternative like localtunnel but I don’t think that’ll work.Thank you, Sir!

So simply changing class_ to class is not going to work. The only thing you need to change is the keyword accepted by the api not the variable name used inside your function.

Kind regardsHi Aindree, I tried to send a request to your application https://your-app2.vercel.app/api with url encoded parameter class=7Q . It should fetch marks of that particular class. But in response it sends {\"marks\": []} . Check if your csv file is correct. Also check if code is correct. Kind regards JivrajFor the questions such as cors, llm i have to locally run the code and submit it.After a while if i have to submit it again the prev url that i have submitted is throwing an error. Maybe becaue it is checking the url again at the time of submission. Fix this issue, the similar issue lies with the image compression problem. when i upload the code and checks and submits it at that time i got the marks but after sometime if i make the change in some other question the file that i uploaded prev is nowhere to found.so please fix this issue @s.anandHi Tushar, For questions which require submitting a url, when you click on save button all those server’s should be running. For that image uploading question one solution would be to keep image in a particular directory, and then upload from there every time you make a submission.

      "Farmers and agribusinesses rely heavily on precise weather information to plan planting schedules, irrigation, harvesting, and protect crops from extreme weather events.\n",

      "ReceiptRevive Analytics is a data recovery and business intelligence firm specializing in processing legacy sales data from paper receipts. Many of the client companies have\n",
      "archives of receipts from past years, which have been digitized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques. However, due to the condition of some receipts (e.g., torn,\n",
      "faded, or partially damaged), the OCR process sometimes produces incomplete JSON data. These imperfections can lead to truncated fields or missing values, which complicates\n",
      "the process of data aggregation and analysis.\n",
      "One of ReceiptRevive's major clients, RetailFlow Inc., operates numerous brick-and-mortar stores and has an extensive archive of old receipts. RetailFlow Inc. needs to recover\n",
      "total sales information from a subset of these digitized receipts to analyze historical sales performance. The provided JSON data contains 100 rows, with each row representing a\n",
      "sales entry. Each entry is expected to include four keys:\n",
      "•\tcity: The city where the sale was made.\n",
      "•\tproduct: The product that was sold.\n",
      "•\tsales: The number of units sold (or sales revenue).\n",
      "•\tid: A unique identifier for the receipt.\n",
      "Due to damage to some receipts during the digitization process, the JSON entries are truncated at the end, and the id field is missing. Despite this, RetailFlow Inc. is primarily\n",

      "As a data recovery analyst at Receipt Revive Analytics, your task is to develop a program that will:\n",
      "1. Parse the Sales Data:\n",
      "Read the provided JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data. Despite the truncated data (specifically the missing id), you must accurately extract the sales figures from\n",
      "each row.\n",
      "2. Data Validation and Cleanup:\n",
      "Ensure that the data is properly handled even if some fields are incomplete. Since the id is missing for some entries, your focus will be solely on the sales values.\n",
      "3. Calculate Total Sales:\n",
      "Sum the sales values across all 100 rows to provide a single aggregate figure that represents the total sales recorded.\n",
      "By successfully recovering and aggregating the sales data, Receipt Revive Analytics will enable RetailFlow Inc. to:\n",
