      "time data, AgroTech helps optimize crop yields, manage resources efficiently, and mitigate risks associated with adverse weather conditions. Accurate and timely weather\n",
      "forecasts are crucial for making informed decisions in agricultural planning and management.\n",
      "Farmers and agribusinesses rely heavily on precise weather information to plan planting schedules, irrigation, harvesting, and protect crops from extreme weather events.\n",
      "However, accessing and processing weather data from multiple sources can be time-consuming and technically challenging. AgroTech Insights seeks to automate the extraction\n",
      "and transformation of weather data to provide seamless, actionable insights to its clients.\n",
      "AgroTech Insights has partnered with various stakeholders to enhance its weather forecasting capabilities. One of the key requirements is to integrate weather forecast data for\n",

      "Your Task\n",
      "As part of this initiative, you are tasked with developing a system that automates the following:\n",
      "1. API Integration and Data Retrieval: Use the BBC Weather API to fetch the weather forecast for Manila. Send a GET request to the locator service to obtain the city's\n",

      "2. Weather Data Extraction: Retrieve the weather forecast data using the obtained locationId. Send a GET request to the weather broker API endpoint with the\n",
      "locationId.\n",
      "3. Data Transformation: Extract the issueDate and enhancedweatherDescription from each day's forecast. Iterate through the forecasts array in the API response and map\n",
      "each issueDate to its corresponding enhancedweatherDescription. Create a JSON object where each key is the issueDate and the value is the\n",

      "s-anand.net is a personal website that had region-specific music content. One of the site's key sections is telugu, which hosts music files and is especially popular among\n",
      "the local audience. The website is powered by robust Apache web servers that record detailed access logs. These logs are essential for understanding user behavior, server\n",
      "load, and content engagement.\n",
      "The author noticed unusual traffic patterns during weekend evenings. To better tailor their content and optimize server resources, they need to know precisely how many\n",
      "successful requests are made to the telugu section during peak hours on Saturdays. Specifically, they are interested in:\n",
      "• Time Window: From 13 until before 23.\n",
      "• Request Type: Only GET requests.\n",
      "• Success Criteria: Requests that return HTTP status codes between 200 and 299.\n",
      "• Data Source: The logs for May 2024 stored in a GZipped Apache log file containing 258,074 rows.\n",
      "The challenge is further complicated by the nature of the log file:\n",
      "• The logs are recorded in the GMT-0500 timezone.\n",
      "• The file format is non-standard in that fields are separated by spaces, with most fields quoted by double quotes, except the Time field.\n",
      "• Some lines have minor formatting issues (41 rows have unique quoting due to how quotes are escaped).\n",
      "Your Task\n",
      "As a data analyst, you are tasked with determining how many successful GET requests for pages under telugu were made on Saturdays between 13 and 23 during May\n",
      "2024. This metric will help:\n",
      "• Scale Resources: Ensure that servers can handle the peak load during these critical hours.\n",

      "• Marketing Insights: Tailor promotional strategies for peak usage times.\n",

      "• Referer: The referer URL. E.g. https://s-anand.net/\n",
      "• User agent: The browser used. This will contain spaces and might have escaped quotes.\n",
      "• Vhost: The virtual host. E.g. s-anand.net\n",
      "• Server: The IP address of the server.\n",

      "ReceiptRevive Analytics is a data recovery and business intelligence firm specializing in processing legacy sales data from paper receipts. Many of the client companies have\n",
      "archives of receipts from past years, which have been digitized using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques. However, due to the condition of some receipts (e.g., torn,\n",
      "faded, or partially damaged), the OCR process sometimes produces incomplete JSON data. These imperfections can lead to truncated fields or missing values, which complicates\n",
      "the process of data aggregation and analysis.\n",
      "One of ReceiptRevive's major clients, RetailFlow Inc., operates numerous brick-and-mortar stores and has an extensive archive of old receipts. RetailFlow Inc. needs to recover\n",
      "total sales information from a subset of these digitized receipts to analyze historical sales performance. The provided JSON data contains 100 rows, with each row representing a\n",
      "sales entry. Each entry is expected to include four keys:\n",
      "•\tcity: The city where the sale was made.\n",
      "•\tproduct: The product that was sold.\n",
      "•\tsales: The number of units sold (or sales revenue).\n",
      "•\tid: A unique identifier for the receipt.\n",
      "Due to damage to some receipts during the digitization process, the JSON entries are truncated at the end, and the id field is missing. Despite this, RetailFlow Inc. is primarily\n",
      "interested in the aggregate sales value.\n",
      "Your Task\n",
      "As a data recovery analyst at Receipt Revive Analytics, your task is to develop a program that will:\n",
      "1. Parse the Sales Data:\n",
      "Read the provided JSON file containing 100 rows of sales data. Despite the truncated data (specifically the missing id), you must accurately extract the sales figures from\n",
      "each row.\n",
      "2. Data Validation and Cleanup:\n",
      "Ensure that the data is properly handled even if some fields are incomplete. Since the id is missing for some entries, your focus will be solely on the sales values.\n",
      "3. Calculate Total Sales:\n",
      "Sum the sales values across all 100 rows to provide a single aggregate figure that represents the total sales recorded.\n",
      "By successfully recovering and aggregating the sales data, Receipt Revive Analytics will enable RetailFlow Inc. to:\n",
      "•\tReconstruct Historical Sales Data: Gain insights into past sales performance even when original receipts are damaged.\n",
      "•\tInform Business Decisions: Use the recovered data to understand sales trends, adjust inventory, and plan future promotions.\n",
      "•\tEnhance Data Recovery Processes: Improve methods for handling imperfect OCR data, reducing future data loss and increasing data accuracy.\n",
